#     Join us for the fourth annual Code for America Brigade Congress where we’ll convene civic tech enthusiasts from across our Network. At the event, you'll connect with Brigade Network volunteers, government and community partners, as well as civic tech professionals from across the country. Together, we'll learn the skills we need to level-up our work in the civic tech ecosystem and our local communities.
#
#     With a packed agenda filled with training sessions, free-form unconference sessions, and lightning talks, attendees will share their vision of what’s next for our national Brigade Network.
